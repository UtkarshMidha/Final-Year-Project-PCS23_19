## Introduction
Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that allows you to create, edit, and run Jupyter notebooks using Python. This guide aims to provide you with a smooth experience using <code>.ipynb</code> files in Google Colab.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- A **Google account**
- Access to **Google Colab** (you can access it at [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com))

## Getting Started
1. Open Google Colab by visiting [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Sign in with your Google account if you haven't already.

## Working with the Notebook
1. Click on the **File** tab in the top-left corner.
2. Select **Upload notebook** to upload the <code>.ipynb</code> file from your local machine.
3. Once uploaded, click on the notebook's filename to open it.

4. You can now view and edit the notebook in Google Colab.

## Running the Notebook
1. Click on the **Runtime** tab in the top menubar.
2. Select **Chanage runtime type** to change the <code>runtime</code> type of the notebook.
3. Once notebook settings opens, **Select runtime type as** <code>Python3</code> , **Hardware accelerator as** <code>GPU</code> and  **GPU type as** <code>T4</code>
